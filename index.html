<p>Little Nightmares 2 Walkthrough<br />Your adventure begins in a dark, gloomy, and foreboding forest. Your name is Mono, but that's just about the only thing you know.</p>
<p>When you gain control at the start of the game, head right, jump over the gap, then pull open the grate to advance - pressing crouch to enter the tunnel.</p>
<p>As you emerge on the other side, cross the clearing, then jump up the bank on the other side, grabbing the ledge to climb up the second.</p>
<p>Then proceed to the log on the next screen, jumping across as you did the earlier gap.</p>
<p>On the other side, jump over the tripwire to avoid an early demise, then continue onto the next screen.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s your first puzzle: knock the teetering box over - either by jumping at it or pulling it - then drag it over to the ledge so you can jump up.</p>
<p>Now crouch through the next tunnel and push through the roots.</p>
<p>Be ready to sprint down the hill to avoid the log, then you&rsquo;re at another impasse.</p>
<p>Climb up through the log, then jump and grab onto the noose, using it to swing to the other side.</p>
<p>At the lever, rotate it until the box is as low as it can go, then use it to skip to the other side.</p>
<p>When you reach the long drop, you need to look down and come to the front of the screen. There&rsquo;s a box you can use to break your fall here before climbing up the other side of the broken bridge.</p>
<p>In the next screen where you scare off the crow, just after that there&rsquo;s another trip snare, which you can trigger with the shoes the bird was picking at. Pick one up, throw it up the small gap with the jump button, then grab and throw in again in the middle of the snare. You can then pass without incident, using the now descended log to jump up to the next area.</p>
<p>After that, take care to avoid the bear traps on the ground, using the illuminated stick to break the last one to slip through the log.</p>
<p>At the bottom, there are a lot of hidden bear traps in the fallen leaves. Pick up the twig beside you, then use it to feel a way to the safe raised stone.</p>
<p>Jump to where the pine cones are, then throw a pine cone into the next pile of leaves to trip another slew of bear traps.</p>
<p>Now jump to the next stone, but grab another pine cone to trip the traps between the stone and the log. Jump on top of the log, then sprint, jump and grab onto the ladder.</p>
<p>In the next clearing, approach and investigate what you find. Use the box by the window to enter.</p>
<p>The Hunter's House<br />Crouch under the table, then push through the door into the hallway.</p>
<p>Instead of going through the illuminated door on the other side, come towards the front of the screen, then go into the room on the left, there&rsquo;s an equipable hat to find here.</p>
<p>Now return to the door that was ajar and squeeze through.</p>
<p>Descend the stairs, and you&rsquo;ll see an illuminated ball of rubber bands to your left and what looks like a breakable door with a child behind it. Go right and you&rsquo;ll see a precarious axe.</p>
<p>Jump up and grab the axe handle, then drag it to the breakable door. Press jump while you&rsquo;re holding it to break down the door and rescue the other child.</p>
<p>Follow them back up the stairs, down the hall and to the right.</p>
<p>In the dining room, follow them: jump onto the table, then jump across to the shelving, then up to the grate.</p>
<p>Help them open the attic by pressing grab on them, then climb up the ladder.</p>
<p>Push the suitcase together then cross the landing with the key above you.</p>
<p>Take a boost on the other side up to the top of the cupboard, then crouch under the shelf on the other side.</p>
<p>In the next area, you need to grab the handle.</p>
<p>Return to the other child and throw down the handle. They&rsquo;ll grab it and raise the rope and cloth for you to climb next to the key. At the top, jump across to the key and it will fall.</p>
<p>Grab it from the floor.</p>
<p>Now head back towards the attic stairs, pulling out the bottom drawer of the cupboard on the right to climb up.</p>
<p>Descend the ladder, then use the key on the big lock on the door on the far side of the room.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re outside.</p>
<p>In the backyard, traipse onto the muddy grass with your new friend and head into the shed across the way.</p>
<p>Start pushing the box in front of you and your mate will help, then use it to jump up to the next window.</p>
<p>In the next room, take the cue from your friend to crouch and sneak past the working baddie.</p>
<p>On the other side of the room, help them push the flap and get ready to run.</p>
